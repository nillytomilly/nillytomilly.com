Welcome to my personal blog, where I post content every day until I reach $1,000,000 in revenue! This blog shares daily updates, thoughts, and insights on various topics.

## Project Overview

This project is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. Visitors can view daily blog posts and use a built-in date selector to navigate to posts by specific dates. It also includes a contact form for visitors to send messages or ask questions.

## Features

- **Daily Blog Posts**: New content added daily.
- **Date Navigation**: Choose a date to navigate directly to that day's post.
- **Contact Form**: A simple form allowing users to send messages.
