        <h1>Posting Every Day Until I Make $1,000,000</h1>
        <p>Hey, I’m Zero (aka Nilly), and welcome to my experiment in turning an internet side project into a million-dollar journey. A few months ago, I learned just enough code to make this site, and now, I’m diving headfirst into the world of online income—tracking every cent from TikTok and Google AdSense in daily posts. Every day, I’ll be sharing what’s on my mind, random thoughts, and real updates on my progress toward that wild $1,000,000 goal. It's a shot in the dark, but hey, why not see where it goes?</p>

            <h2>Day 1 / November 14, 2024: Zero test2</h2>
            <p><strong>Hey there! I’m Zero.</strong>Welcome to my first post. Just to clear things up – Zero isn’t my real name. It’s a pseudonym that kinda goes with the website name. Shoutout to all the <em>Holes</em> fans out there (the movie, not holes in the ground or, ahem, other places). Anyway, I’d like to keep my identity on the down-low, but here’s what I will say: I’m in my early 30s, living in the U.S., unemployed, and honestly, just trying to figure out what the hell I’m doing with my life – especially when it comes to making money.<br>
            <br>

            A few months ago, I thought, "Why not learn to code for fun? Maybe it could lead to a career change or something." So, I dove into some YouTube tutorials. Turns out coding isn’t my thing. But I did pick up just enough skills to build this website! So, here’s my "delulu" plan (yeah, I’m hip): I’m trying to figure out how to make money online. Sounds a little crazy, right? Especially when I'm too shy to even post on TikTok or Instagram. I wouldn’t even know what to post to make money there. But hey, if I’m thinking crazy, let’s go even crazier – let me set a goal of $1,000,000. Yeah, a million bucks. Enough to support my parents and myself until WWIII – get ready, y’all. Jk.<br>
            <br>
            
            I’m not really sure what to call this whole thing – an experiment? A random side project? Probably both? I get it, it sounds ludicrous – I’m not special, and I’m not asking for your pity (yes, yes I am :3). But I’m not asking for donations. Nope, not at all. If you want to support me on this ridiculous journey you can click on the <strong>Google Ads</strong> on this page. I'd really appreciate it. Maybe one day, I can get a sponsor and won’t need to ask for ad clicks. (Dollar Tree, I’m waiting for your call!)<br>
            <br>
            
            Now, this website? It’s going to be a mess of daily random posts – whatever’s on my mind that day. Each post will also include an update on how much this website and my TikTok account have made (if anything, lol). I’ve always been curious about how much TikTokers actually make and how much Google Ads pay, so why not share the journey with you all?<br>
            <br>
            
            If you like random thoughts, or just want to follow someone shooting for a crazy goal like a million bucks, then you’re in the right place. I’m still figuring out what exactly this website will be. And as for TikTok? Yeah, I’m still figuring that out too. No plan yet, but I aim to post once a day. Who knows what’ll go up? That’s part of the fun, right? Or maybe not. Anyway, the link to my TikTok is up top, in case you want to follow me trying to figure it all out.<br>
            <br>
            
            Oh, and before I forget – I’m going to share a “Song of the Day” with each post. Music’s a huge part of my life, even though I can’t play a single instrument. I did inherit my dad’s amazing singing voice though… and by amazing, I mean totally tone-deaf. Sorry, pops. But I still love music, so I’ll be sharing what I’m vibing to.<br>
            <br>
            
            With that said, today’s Song of the Day is <em>A Milli</em> by Lil Wayne. Pretty self-explanatory pick, right? Lil Wayne was the sh*t back in my day.<br>
            <br>
            
            So here we are, day one. I’m still waiting for Google AdSense to verify my account to start running ads. Today’s progress update: $0.00 out of A Milli. (See what I did there?). Anyway, here's an old video of a guy winning a million bucks on <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</em>. Cheers!<br>
            <br>
            
            <strong>P.S.</strong> This was a long post. I'll try to keep them more Kevin Hart.<br>
