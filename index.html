        <h1>Posting Every Day Until I Make $1,000,000</h1>
        <p> Hello there! I’m Zero, and this is my very first post. Just to clear things up – Zero isn’t my real name. It’s a pseudonym that kinda goes with nillytomilly. Shoutout to all the Holes fans out there (the movie, not holes in the ground or, ahem, other places). Anyway, I’d like to remain anonymous, but I’ll tell you this much: I’m in my early 30s, living in the U.S., unemployed, and struggling to figure out what the hell I’m doing with my life and how to make money.

        A few months ago, I thought, "Why not learn to code for fun? Maybe it could lead to a career change or something." So, I jumped into YouTube tutorials, gave it a shot, and… turns out coding isn’t my thing. But I did pick up just enough skills to build this website! So, here’s my delulu plan (yeah, I’m hip): I’m trying to figure out how to make money online. Sounds insane, right? Especially for someone who’s too shy to even post on TikTok or Instagram (and, honestly, I wouldn’t even know what to post that could make money on those platforms). But hey, if I’m thinking crazy, let’s go even crazier – let’s set a goal of $1,000,000. That’s a lot of cash. Enough to support my parents and myself until WWIII – get ready, y’all. Jk.
        
        I’m not really sure what to call this whole thing – an experiment? A random side project? Probably both? I know it sounds wild, and trust me, I get it – I’m not special, and I’m not asking for your pity (yes, yes I am :3). If you want to support me on this ridiculous journey, I’m not asking for donations. Nope, not at all. But if you do want to help, you can click on the Google Ads on this page. I'd really appreciate it. Maybe one day, I can get a sponsor and won’t need to ask for ad clicks. (Dollar Tree, hit me up!)
        
        This website is going to be a mess of daily random posts – whatever I’m thinking that day. Each post will also include an update on how much this website and my TikTok account have made (if anything, lol). I’ve always been curious about how much TikTokers actually make and how much Google Ads pay, so why not share the journey with you all?
        
        If you’re into random thoughts, or just want to follow someone trying to hit a wild goal (like, you know, a million bucks), then you’re in the right place. I’m still figuring out what exactly this website will be. And as for TikTok? Yeah, I’m still figuring that out too. No plan yet, but I aim to post once a day. Who knows what’ll go up? That’s part of the fun, right? Or maybe not. Anyway, the link to my TikTok is up top, in case you want to follow me trying to figure it all out.
        
        Oh, and I’m also going to share a Song of the Day with each post. I love music, even though I can't play any instruments. I did inherit my dad’s amazing singing voice though (and by amazing, I mean tone-deaf – sorry, pops). But I still love music, so I want to share what I’m vibing to.
        
        With that said, today’s Song of the Day is "A Milli" by Lil Wayne. Self-explanatory pick, right? Lil Wayne was the sh*t in the 2000s.
        
        This is day one, and I’m still waiting on Google Adsense verification for the ads. So, for today’s progress update, needless to say, I’ve made $0.00 out of A Milli. (See what I did there?) Cheers!
        
        P.S. This was a long post. I'll try to keep them a lot shorter.</p>
